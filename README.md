There are two versions in this repository:

 * original,
 * half-size.

 I would recommend to print original version, as this is how author designed it.

## Changelog

* 2020-9-16 first version, no pdf, not verified - be careful!
* 2020-9-16 fixed bleed on all pages
* 2020-9-17 add scripts to automate pdf creation
* 2020-9-17 fix original size page 12 backs
* 2020-9-17 fix original size pages 17-22, converted Minimal Mono to path, to render as intended by author
* 2020-9-17 fix original size token sizes, changed order - optional tokens on last page
